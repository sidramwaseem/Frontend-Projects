### What I learned

Development of this project indeed helped me in API fetching. I always struggle with this portion and I beleive this project did improve it.

A new thing that I tried: 

```css
.dice-container:hover{
  box-shadow:
  0 0 20px 10px #52ffa8,
  0 0 50px 30px #8ceebd
}
```

If you want more help with box-shadows, I'd recommend checking out [Box-Shadow](https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/) to learn more.
